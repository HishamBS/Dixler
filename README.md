## Planning and Development Process

After we took the class on manipulating the dom , i got the idea of developing this application , i was always facinated by pixel art , and i wanted to create something that will benifit all fans of pixel art.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

* I used console.log().
* grab the error and google it.


### Future Features

* adding a resizable frame on user choosing.
* adding different brush sizes.
* giving the user the ability to copy a shape.
* different kinds of shape (circle , square , etc..)
